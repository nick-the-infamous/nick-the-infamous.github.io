      <p>Hello! I'm Nick, just a Guild Wars 2 player and a warrior main.</p>
      
      <h3>My YouTube Channel</h3>
      <p>Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NickTheInfamous" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> where I share gameplay, build guides, etc. for Guild Wars 2 players of all experience levels.</p>
      <p>I also maintain a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfvsp7LCVdzWv6i_5ftGj1mZMfc2LF05_" target="_blank">playlist of low intensity builds</a> that are perfect for players who want to be effective while keeping things simple and easy to play. I recommend using the low intensity build tab here though, but your preference if you like the playlist.</p>
      <p>I regularly post POV (Point of View) videos showcasing my builds across different game modes. These videos demonstrate that you can perform well in most public groups playing these builds. That won't always be true, some groups are much better than others. Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfvsp7LCVdzWTo96E_BMrQc5vY3JY2uI9" target="_blank">POVs playlist</a> to see them in action.</p>
      
      <h3>My Background</h3>
      <p>I'm a veteran Guild Wars 2 player who has been playing on and off since the game's original release. Over time I've accumulated over 2,000 raid boss kills and most (but not all) CM clears. I haven't been playing in the last few years but I came back recently and it's been a lot of fun. </p>
      <p>I also don't claim to be a pro player. The stuff I create may be further optimized so I don't claim that I have the absolute best stuff or best knowledge of the game.</p>
