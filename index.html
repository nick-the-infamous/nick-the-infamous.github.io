    Here you'll find my collection of Guild Wars 2 low intensity builds. These are beginner-friendly and designed to
    help you get into endgame PvE content quickly, succeed in any encounter, and fit well in most squads.

            <p>
              LI builds are designed around comfort and ease of use, with varying performance based on the number of active skills required.
              Below you'll find two ways to understand what to expect from these builds:
            </p>

            <h1>Number of Buttons</h1>
            
            <h5>1-2 Button Builds</h5>
            <p>
              These builds focus on maximum accessibility with minimal inputs. Perfect for beginners or those who prefer
              minimal complexity. They're ideal for learning encounters with minimal mental overhead while still contributing meaningfully.
            </p>

            <h5>3-4 Button Builds</h5>
            <p>
              These builds strike a balance between performance and accessibility, requiring slightly more engagement.
              They introduce basic skill prioritization while remaining approachable for players comfortable with their class fundamentals.
            </p>

            <h5>5+ Button Builds</h5>
            <p>
              These builds offer higher performance at the cost of some accessibility. They require understanding of skill 
              priorities and basic rotation concepts, making them ideal for players who want strong performance while 
              maintaining a manageable learning curve.
            </p>

            <h1>DPS Performance</h1>
            
            <h5>30-32k DPS</h5>
            <p>
              These builds typically place you in the lower third of DPS charts in most public groups.
            </p>

            <h5>33-35k DPS</h5>
            <p>
              In public groups, you can expect to place in the middle of DPS charts with these builds.
            </p>

            <h5>36-38k+ DPS</h5>
            <p>
              These higher performing builds will place you in the upper third of DPS in most public groups.
            </p>

            <h1>Real Fights</h1>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              While the builds have some trade-offs (outlined below), don't let that discourage you! These builds are more than capable of handling most content in the game and will serve you well. I just want to call out some obvious downsides.</p>
            <h5>Power Builds</h5>
            <p>These builds may show lower damage in burst-oriented fights due to their consistent, sustained damage output. While standard power builds typically have strong burst openers (strong initial DPS burst in the first 10 to 20 seconds before tapering off), these LI versions may start slower but will often catch up as the fight progresses.</p>
            <h5>Condition Builds</h5>
            <p>Some of these condition builds require A LOT of time to ramp up their damage, which can result in lower performance in phased encounters. Additionally, torment-heavy builds may show reduced effectiveness against highly mobile bosses, as movement reduces torment's damage output.</p>

            <p class="build-description" style="margin-top: 1.5em;">
              <em>Note: The relationship between button count and DPS output can vary by class and build. Some classes may
              achieve higher DPS with fewer buttons due to their design and available tools.</em>

              You can run full grieving and krait runes for a small damage boost (probably add on like 1k DPS). However if you are a new player and you are building out your first ascended set get viper's instead it is more useful across way more builds.

              You can also finish auto chains for a very small damage boost. However this is a bit 'harder' to do, so it's not necessary.

              I didn't get higher damage with UF because I think your base crit is already high. It's not 100% min maxed
              (we overcap on expertise here) so you can probably push damage a little bit more by swapping in some
              sinister pieces/running condi primary food instead of being cheap like me but it's good enough trust me. I
              could see it pushing 34k.

              You take river's flow to be able to 'afk' generate flow. Technically speaking you don't 'need' it so you
              can get a slightly higher dps number running Unseen Sword but it makes flow generation a lot tighter. I
              would just recommend River's Flow if you are a beginner.

IF YOU ARE DYING: use minstrel's or giver's stats.

You run Febe relic (swiftness on healing skill) because that's your only source of swiftness for your subgroup with 4 buttons + no weapon swap.

You can take Vigorous Shouts (last trait line tactics) for more raw healing but you lose stability."
                target="_blank">link</a><br>
              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Cast "To The Limit!" (heal), "For Great Justice!", F3, F1 off cooldown.

              You output: 25 might, fury, protection, swiftness, regen, alacrity, periodic stability, periodic vigor,
              barrier, strong condi cleanse through F1 F3.<br>

              You will (probably) not be able to solo heal a squad or the build may not work well on more
              threatening/higher damaging scenario. If you play this the overheal from the other healer will be
              assisting you some. Or if people are eating a lot of damage it will also not work well and you have to
              press your skills. In those scenarios Staff 2 Staff 3 Staff 5 are good burst healing skills to press. I
              focused low intensity on providing good boons + sustained healing. Unfortunately healers need to be
              versatile somewhat and adapt to the situation.

              chains (casting skills leads to higher damage) so don't finish your auto attack chains and cast skills.
              Basically make the priority decision after completing an auto attack. Spam outrage off cool down for
              berserk uptime.

              MAKE SURE TO LEAVE SWORD 4 INSIDE THE ENEMY. Don’t pull it out with recasting sword 4. It applies torment

              I realized in this video I had a dragon's offhand sword instead of a vipers sword. With vipers this
              achieved ~38.2k. Not that much different but a slight increase.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Rotation is basically f1 - axe 4 - axe 5. Spam Dolyak and Stamina signets off
              cooldown. Precast signets for ferocity buff.<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity warrior build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              Do note that you crit cap with Unsuspecting Foe. If you want to crit cap always you can swap to assassins
              rings and accuracy sigil instead of impact. This will result in slightly lower damage.

              If you want to min max Unsuspecting Foe you could run Valkyrie pieces and get more vitality since the
              extra precision from Berserker's is unnecessary. Up to you.

              I tried out signet of fury but I didn't see a significant DPS difference. I decided not to run it because
              it has a small cast time vs the other signets I spam here. I wanted to make it really easy to play and
              signet cast time may screw something up.

              I don't like kick because it requires the player to look at peak performance uptime and kick has more
              animation locks. I feel like it's not 'beginner' enough. I wanted to make it 'smooth' to the feel.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> This is a priority based rotation. The priority in order is: F1 (Burst) - Blood
              Reckoning into F1 - GS 2 (Hundred Blades) - GS 4 (Bladetrail) - GS 5 (Rush). You make a decision on what
              to cast between auto attack chains. Do not cancel auto attack chains. Spam outrage off cool down for
              berserk uptime.

              Example: auto attack chain into F1 into GS 2 into GS 4 into auto attack chain. An auto attack chain is 3
              hits on the greatsword (GS 1).<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner warrior build for fractal/raid/strike content.

              Looking back over it I made a few minor mistakes I think 39.5k+ is possible if you play it well.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Don't cancel auto attack. Cast Procession of Blades in between auto attack
              chains. Cast Test of Faith (this has no cast time) off cooldown.<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity guardian build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              You can also just auto attack and you will achieve ~30k dps (you want relic of the brawler in that case).
              There is videos on that already I am not going to redo those.

              I think you can technically achieve slightly higher dps if you 'stagger' the trap usage to get higher
              dragonhunter relic uptime but no one is going to be doing that playing this build.

              I am not going to redo/repost this but shoutout to this goat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wLG6I5fuOY.
              You can technically fully afk + get ~33k dps. But it requires a lot of assassin's pieces so I am guessing
              anyone playing this kind of build may not have easy the easiest access to assassin's stat.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Basically spam mantra of flame off cooldown. Fit in axe 2 and torch 4 after an
              axe auto attack. To make it simplest you can align axe 2 torch 4 casts to be synced like I did.<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity guardian build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              I spent a while trying out variants of this one but this was the simplest I found. It's kind of sad
              because most of the firebrand trait line is dead but mantra of flame is simply that good. There were a few
              4 button variants I found for firebrand and willbender that did 33.5kish but I felt like they were too
              high apm for a low intensity build because it required Purging Flames and you had to also time axe autos
              for Purging Flames so I didn't feel comfortable with it like I did for warrior (where warrior 4 button
              build I have is just spam 2 signets off cooldown so I felt more comfortable with 4 buttoning that one).

              I decided to post this one even though others have this build. I saw that others were running other utilities or sometimes the initiative regeneration signet. However those versions yielded me ~28k DPS. I switched to impact instead and ran full zerkers with precision signet to get 29k. So a very slight increase if you plan on running this build as a 1 buttoner.

              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity engineer build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              Realistic Conditions = 10 boons, 10 conditions on golem. This build has traits that scale with both boons
              on you and conditions on enemy. This means the damage will be variable some based on your composition.
              Sometimes you will do more sometimes less.

              I don't really play engi. This is from a request. This may not be the absolute best option but this is the
              best I came up with.

              I found rifle turret belt skill spam to be about similar dps as the gyro (a little worse) but the
              cooldowns lined up less nicely + you had a lot less cleave. So I took gyro. And superspeed spam will be
              useful.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Sword 5 is above Sword 2, cast after an auto attack. Spam F1 shatter off
              cooldown.<br>

              Technically speaking if you have 100% slow uptime from other sources "Danger Time" (middle trait
              Chronomancer) is a greater damage increase (I got around 34.5k running it). However slow is a rarer
              condition and I don't think it is realistic to expect 100% uptime from your team. I don't think it's
              possible to maintain 100% uptime on slow yourself with 3 buttons and do decent damage.

              Also I found Sword 5, Heal, F1 to be equivalent in damage to this. However I preferred this since it's
              less clone reliant and should be better on bosses that move.

              I don't play much mesmer so let me know if you think there is a better way to do this. This is the best I
              found from my exploration.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Rotation is dagger 2, shroud, shroud 2. Make sure to cast dagger 2 right before
              and right after you enter/exit shroud.

              Precast elite skill and/or heal skill for blight stacks. You can run golem instead if you need CC. However
              recasting heal/elite can be helpful if you lose blight during boss phases for example.

              Also I realized that you should cast elite into heal for 20 stacks of blight at start instead of 15,
              ignore that mistake. Anyway you should probably run golem + just precast heal skill.<br>

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Opener is both wells into dagger 2 into shroud into shroud 2 spam.

              Rotation is basically dagger 2 when you exit shroud, both wells, auto attack until dagger 2 comes up, cast
              dagger 2 before you enter shroud, spam shroud 2. Repeat.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Opener is heal skill into elite into shroud into shroud 2 spam.

              Rotation is pistol 2 into focus 4 into elite (if available) into focus 4 into pistol 2 into maybe focus 4
              if it's up into shroud and shroud 2 spam. Repeat.<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity necromancer build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              I had a lot of problems with necromancer surprisingly. I think this is maybe still a little undercooked
              and I may come back to this. I think necromancer is generally "faceroll" where you want to cast all of
              your skills so it's kind of hard to "condense" that into a few clicks.

              Basically the problem is that 2 buttons are always shroud, shroud 2 (and weapon skill 2). Either condition
              elite is better than BiP from my testing so that's the 3rd button. So 4th button has to be life force
              generation I think... hence why I ran parasitic contagion. We can't fit in corruptions well. Life force
              generation was lacking hard so I ran focus which I think is best for life force regen in this scenario.

              Dagger main hand ended up being low damage. I think the lack of conditions during non shroud periods loses
              hard. Basically dagger had a damage problem rather than a life force problem and it was hard to fix so I
              gave up on it. I try to aim for my builds to be 30k+ dps.

              Let me know if you have any ideas for improving it! I may come back to it later. At least the nice thing
              is that with Parasitic Contagion you will be very healthy.
