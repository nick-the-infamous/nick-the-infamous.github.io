        <p>
          This page is designed to help you quickly and comfortably enter endgame PvE using
          Low-Intensity (LI) builds. These builds focus on minimal inputs, low stress, and
          consistency — perfect for beginners, casual players, or anyone who wants strong performance without complex
          rotations.

        <h3>📹 Training Golem Setup (Video Guide)</h3>
        <p>
          Before practicing a build, make sure you set up the training golem properly.
          Watch this setup guide:

        </p>

        <h3>⚙️ Important Tips Before Benchmarking</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Equip the correct <strong>stats, gear pieces, runes, sigils</strong></li>
          <li>Verify all <strong>traits</strong> match the build exactly</li>
          <li>Use the correct <strong>food and utility</strong> buffs (10% damage increase)</li>
          <li>Check that you have the right <strong>infusions</strong> (optional, 1-2% damage increase)</li>
          <li>Apply <strong>boons</strong> on yourself that match your build expectations</li>
          <li>Apply <strong>conditions</strong> on the golem that match your build expectations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">What to Expect from LI Builds</h3>
        <p>
          LI builds are intentionally designed around comfort, low inputs, and ease of use. Because of that, their
          performance in real group content varies depending on how many skills a build requires. Here’s a general
          expectation of how LI builds usually perform in pug raids, strikes, and fractals:
        </p>

        <h4>✔ 1-Button Builds</h4>
        <p>
          These are the simplest possible builds, often using nothing but auto-attacks and a single skill. They are
          extremely easy to pilot and great for beginners, but they naturally sit toward the lower half of DPS charts
          in real pug groups. They’re consistent, safe, and perfect for learning endgame PvE without pressure.
        </p>

        <h4>✔ 2–3 Button Builds</h4>
        <p>
          These builds add a couple of important skills on cooldown while still avoiding complex rotations. With just
          a tiny increase in input, you typically land somewhere in the middle of group DPS charts. They’re balanced,
          comfortable, and reliable for almost any encounter.
        </p>

        <h4>✔ 4–5+ Button Builds</h4>
        <p>
          These builds still qualify as low-intensity but include more impactful cooldowns and priority skills. With
          only a handful of buttons, you can often reach the top of DPS meters in average pug groups—especially in
          encounters with good uptime. These offer the highest damage potential while remaining far easier than
          standard meta rotations.
        </p>

        <p>
          No matter which category you choose, LI builds are meant to remove the stress of high-APM gameplay while
          still letting you contribute meaningful damage in every type of group content. Pick the level of input
          that feels comfortable, and you’ll do great.

              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity warrior build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              This uses Unsuspecting Foe to crit cap. If you want to always be crit capped take a look at sigil of
              accuracy + assassins pieces.

              for the love of god do not play this awful build... At least play the spellbreaker one button variant...

              In all honesty though I guarantee if you play this you will probably still be beating someone if your
              squad in pugs. The nice thing about this is that it works with moving targets (there is no turrets or
              symbols or some other bs).

              I spent too long trying to make grieving + sinister mix with weird rune choices beat straight berserker.
              It was not worth the time. I think there is too much going for strike damage with trait choices so condi
              has a hard time competing with power.

              content.

              Unsuspecting Foe yielded similar damage to blade master. I suspect you can push it a bit more if you take
              off some expertise and swap to sinister and slot in blademaster. I could see it pushing 32k if you min
              max. I could also see grieving + krait potentially outperforming since it's a single condition build.
              However my general philosophy is that I try to make the gear as "generic" as possible so that you can
              reuse that vipers/berserkers/whatever gear across other builds. So if you are new try to aim for full
              vipers gear as that will be useful across other builds and classes.

              I am just happy that condi warrior is now possible at lower intensity.

              I didn't get higher damage with UF because I think your base crit is already high. It's not 100% min maxed
              (we overcap on expertise here) so you can probably push damage a little bit more by swapping in some
              sinister pieces/running condi primary food instead of being cheap like me but it's good enough trust me. I
              could see it pushing 34k.

              You take river's flow to be able to 'afk' generate flow. Technically speaking you don't 'need' it so you
              can get a slightly higher dps number running Unseen Sword but it makes flow generation a lot tighter. I
              would just recommend River's Flow if you are a beginner.

              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity warrior build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              Do note that you crit cap with Unsuspecting Foe. If you want to crit cap always you can swap to assassins
              rings and accuracy sigil instead of impact. This will result in slightly lower damage.

              If you want to min max Unsuspecting Foe you could run Valkyrie pieces and get more vitality since the
              extra precision from Berserker's is unnecessary. Up to you.

              I tried out signet of fury but I didn't see a significant DPS difference. I decided not to run it because
              it has a small cast time vs the other signets I spam here. I wanted to make it really easy to play and
              signet cast time may screw something up.

              I don't like kick because it requires the player to look at peak performance uptime and kick has more
              animation locks. I feel like it's not 'beginner' enough. I wanted to make it 'smooth' to the feel.

              You will (probably) not be able to solo heal a squad or the build may not work well on more
              threatening/higher damaging scenario. If you play this the overheal from the other healer will be
              assisting you some. Or if people are eating a lot of damage it will also not work well and you have to
              press your skills. In those scenarios Staff 2 Staff 3 Staff 5 are good burst healing skills to press. I
              focused low intensity on providing good boons + sustained healing. Unfortunately healers need to be
              versatile somewhat and adapt to the situation.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Rotation is basically f1 - axe 4 - axe 5. Spam Dolyak and Stamina signets off
              cooldown. Precast signets for ferocity buff.

              Opener is To The Limit into Chant of Action (for motivation, read grandmaster trait in paragon) into F1.

              Do note that you want to maintain 7+ stacks of motivation. If you drop motivation try to recast F2 to
              regain motivation.<br>

              Since snowcrows decided to bench power paragon (it's currently at ~40k) I decided to do post this low
              intensity variant since it ends up kind of close to real bench. Also there was some kind in strikes
              yesterday playing the SC build and his dps was below my friend who is brand new to guild wars lol. You
              guys don't have to be afraid of playing these builds you will outperform like 80%+ in pugs very easily.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> This is a priority based rotation. The priority in order is: F1 (Burst) - Blood
              Reckoning into F1 - Sword 4 (Impale) - Sword 3 (Final Thrust). You actually want to cancel auto attack
              chains (casting skills leads to higher damage) so don't finish your auto attack chains and cast skills.
              Basically make the priority decision after completing an auto attack. Spam outrage off cool down for
              berserk uptime.

              MAKE SURE TO LEAVE SWORD 4 INSIDE THE ENEMY. Don’t pull it out with recasting sword 4. It applies torment
              while it’s inside the enemy.<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner warrior build for fractal/raid/strike content.

              I realized in this video I had a dragon's offhand sword instead of a vipers sword. With vipers this
              achieved ~38.2k. Not that much different but a slight increase.

              Do note that you crit cap with Unsuspecting Foe. If you want to crit cap always you can swap to assassins
              rings and accuracy sigil instead of impact. This will result in slightly lower damage.

              If you want to min max Unsuspecting Foe you could run Valkyrie pieces and get more vitality since the
              extra precision from Berserker's is unnecessary. Up to you.

              I tried out signet of fury but I didn't see a significant DPS difference. I decided not to run it because
              it has a small cast time vs the other signets I spam here. I wanted to make it really easy to play and
              signet cast time may screw something up.

              I don't like kick because it requires the player to look at peak performance uptime and kick has more
              animation locks. I feel like it's not 'beginner' enough. I wanted to make it 'smooth' to the feel.

              to cast between auto attack chains. Do not cancel auto attack chains. Spam outrage off cool down for
              berserk uptime.

              Example: auto attack chain into F1 into GS 2 into GS 4 into auto attack chain. An auto attack chain is 3

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Don't cancel auto attack. Cast Procession of Blades in between auto attack
              chains. Cast Test of Faith (this has no cast time) off cooldown.<br>

              content.

              You can also just auto attack and you will achieve ~30k dps (you want relic of the brawler in that case).
              There is videos on that already I am not going to redo those.

              I think you can technically achieve slightly higher dps if you 'stagger' the trap usage to get higher
              dragonhunter relic uptime but no one is going to be doing that playing this build.

              I am not going to redo/repost this but shoutout to this goat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wLG6I5fuOY.
              You can technically fully afk + get ~33k dps. But it requires a lot of assassin's pieces so I am guessing
              anyone playing this kind of build may not have easy the easiest access to assassin's stat.

              axe auto attack. To make it simplest you can align axe 2 torch 4 casts to be synced like I did.<br>

              content.

              I spent a while trying out variants of this one but this was the simplest I found. It's kind of sad
              because most of the firebrand trait line is dead but mantra of flame is simply that good. There were a few
              4 button variants I found for firebrand and willbender that did 33.5kish but I felt like they were too
              high apm for a low intensity build because it required Purging Flames and you had to also time axe autos
              for Purging Flames so I didn't feel comfortable with it like I did for warrior (where warrior 4 button
              build I have is just spam 2 signets off cooldown so I felt more comfortable with 4 buttoning that one).

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> More or less Sword 2 into Grenade Barrage or Shredder Gyro. Priority order is
              Sword 2, Grenade Barrage, Shredder Gyro. Try not to cancel auto attack chains.<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity engineer build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              Realistic Conditions = 10 boons, 10 conditions on golem. This build has traits that scale with both boons
              on you and conditions on enemy. This means the damage will be variable some based on your composition.
              Sometimes you will do more sometimes less.

              I don't really play engi. This is from a request. This may not be the absolute best option but this is the
              best I came up with.

              I found rifle turret belt skill spam to be about similar dps as the gyro (a little worse) but the
              cooldowns lined up less nicely + you had a lot less cleave. So I took gyro. And superspeed spam will be
              useful.

              Technically speaking if you have 100% slow uptime from other sources "Danger Time" (middle trait
              Chronomancer) is a greater damage increase (I got around 34.5k running it). However slow is a rarer
              condition and I don't think it is realistic to expect 100% uptime from your team. I don't think it's
              possible to maintain 100% uptime on slow yourself with 3 buttons and do decent damage.

              Also I found Sword 5, Heal, F1 to be equivalent in damage to this. However I preferred this since it's
              less clone reliant and should be better on bosses that move.

              I don't play much mesmer so let me know if you think there is a better way to do this. This is the best I
              found from my exploration.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Rotation is dagger 2, shroud, shroud 2. Make sure to cast dagger 2 right before
              and right after you enter/exit shroud.

              Precast elite skill and/or heal skill for blight stacks. You can run golem instead if you need CC. However
              recasting heal/elite can be helpful if you lose blight during boss phases for example.

              Also I realized that you should cast elite into heal for 20 stacks of blight at start instead of 15,
              ignore that mistake. Anyway you should probably run golem + just precast heal skill.<br>

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Opener is both wells into dagger 2 into shroud into shroud 2 spam.

              Rotation is basically dagger 2 when you exit shroud, both wells, auto attack until dagger 2 comes up, cast
              dagger 2 before you enter shroud, spam shroud 2. Repeat.

              <strong>ROTATION:</strong> Opener is heal skill into elite into shroud into shroud 2 spam.

              Rotation is pistol 2 into focus 4 into elite (if available) into focus 4 into pistol 2 into maybe focus 4
              if it's up into shroud and shroud 2 spam. Repeat.<br>
              <strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This is a beginner/low intensity necromancer build for fractal/raid/strike
              content.

              I had a lot of problems with necromancer surprisingly. I think this is maybe still a little undercooked
              and I may come back to this. I think necromancer is generally "faceroll" where you want to cast all of
              your skills so it's kind of hard to "condense" that into a few clicks.

              Basically the problem is that 2 buttons are always shroud, shroud 2 (and weapon skill 2). Either condition
              elite is better than BiP from my testing so that's the 3rd button. So 4th button has to be life force
              generation I think... hence why I ran parasitic contagion. We can't fit in corruptions well. Life force
              generation was lacking hard so I ran focus which I think is best for life force regen in this scenario.

              Dagger main hand ended up being low damage. I think the lack of conditions during non shroud periods loses
              hard. Basically dagger had a damage problem rather than a life force problem and it was hard to fix so I
              gave up on it. I try to aim for my builds to be 30k+ dps.

              Let me know if you have any ideas for improving it! I may come back to it later. At least the nice thing
              is that with Parasitic Contagion you will be very healthy.
